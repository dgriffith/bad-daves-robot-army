## üéñÔ∏è Command Structure - The Workflows

### 1. The PRD ‚Üí Production Pipeline

The most powerful workflow - from idea to deployed feature:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] -->|/create-prd| B[PRD Document]
    B -->|/process-prd-feedback| B1[Refined PRD]
    B1 -->|/implementation-plan-from-prd| C[Implementation Plan]
    C -->|/process-implementation-plan-feedback| C1[Battle-Ready Plan]
    C1 -->|/tasks-from-plan| D[GitHub Issues]
    D -->|/implement-issue| E[Implemented Code]
    E -->|Review & Test| F[Production]
```

**Example Campaign - Operation: Feature Storm**
```bash
# Step 1: Initial reconnaissance - Create a PRD from your requirements
/create-prd requirements/new-feature.md

# Step 2: Review the battle plan
# Step 3: Process intelligence feedback
/process-prd-feedback "Add mobile support, need air cover"

# Step 4: Generate tactical implementation plan
/implementation-plan-from-prd /plans/prd-*.md

# Step 5: Refine tactics based on field reports
/process-implementation-plan-feedback "Prioritize backend first"

# Step 6: Deploy troops - Create GitHub issues from the plan
/tasks-from-plan /plans/implementation-plan-*.md

# Step 7: Execute the mission - Implement each issue
/implement-issue 101  # Alpha squad, move out!
/implement-issue 102  # Bravo squad, go go go!
```

### 2. The Review & Improve Protocol

Systematic code improvement across all dimensions:

```bash
# Security audit
/security-review "current changes"

# Performance analysis  
/perf-review src/slow-module

# Architecture review
/arch-review "PR #45"

# Full quality assessment
/quality-review

# Database optimization
/database-review
```

Each review generates a comprehensive report in `/plans/` with:
- Current state analysis
- Prioritized issues (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Detailed improvement plan
- Effort estimates
- Success metrics

### 3. The Learning & Mastery Path

For understanding and knowledge transfer:

```bash
# Understand the codebase
/codebase-overview

# Get personalized explanations
/explain src/complex-algorithm.ts

# Approach with fresh curiosity
/beginners-mind authentication flow

# Create a learning path
/learn React hooks in this project

# Deep dive into architecture
/arch-review
```

## üéÆ Advanced Tactics

### Scope Modifiers for Reviews - Target Acquisition

All review commands support intelligent target acquisition:

- **No argument** - Review entire project
- **Path** - Review specific file/directory
- **"current changes"** - Review uncommitted changes
- **"recent changes"** - Review recent commits  
- **"PR #123"** - Review a pull request

### Coordinated Attacks - Combined Arms Operations

Deploy multiple agents for complex operations - shock and awe tactics:

```bash
# Modernize and optimize simultaneously
/modernization-review src/legacy
/perf-review src/legacy
/tasks-from-plan /plans/modernization-review-*.md
```

### Specialized Formations - Battle Tactics

For specific combat scenarios:

**Operation: Fort Knox - Security Hardening**
```bash
/security-review
/test-review  # Ensure security tests
/deployment-review  # Secure deployment
```

**Operation: Lightning Strike - Performance Blitz**
```bash
/perf-review
/database-review
/concurrency-review
```

**Operation: Zero Defects - Quality Offensive**
```bash
/quality-review
/test-review
/doc-review
```

## üìä Best Practices from the Field

### 1. Start with Reconnaissance - Know Your Battlefield
Always begin with `/codebase-overview` or `/explain` to understand the terrain.

### 2. Plan Before Attacking - No Plan Survives First Contact (But Have One Anyway)
Use `/create-prd` or `/decompose-issue` for complex tasks. Let the development-manager break down the work.

### 3. Deploy Specialists - Right Tool for the Right Mission
Don't send infantry when you need special forces. Use @agent-api-designer for APIs, not @agent-architect. Would you send a tank pilot to defuse a bomb?

### 4. Review After Action - Debrief and Learn
After implementation, run relevant review commands to ensure quality.

### 5. Document Victories - War Stories for Future Generations
The @agent-code-documentor should follow major implementations to maintain clarity. Every great battle deserves its historian.

### 6. Coordinate Forces - Combined Arms Doctrine
Multiple agents can work in parallel - use the todo system as your battle map. Remember: amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Your Workflow

### With GitHub Issues
```bash
# Decompose large issues
/decompose-issue 42

# Implement with the right specialist
/implement-issue 43

# Create PRs with context
/create-pr "recent changes"
```

### With Existing Code
```bash
# Understand before modifying
/explain src/module.ts

# Review before refactoring
/refactor-review src/module.ts

# Modernize systematically
/modernization-review src/legacy
```

### For New Features
```bash
# Start with requirements
/create-prd feature-spec.md

# Or decompose an issue
/decompose-issue 100

# Then implement systematically
/implement-issue 101
```

## üéØ Mission Types - Choose Your Engagement

### The Quick Strike - Surgical Precision
For small, focused tasks:
```bash
/implement-issue 42
```

### The Planned Campaign - Full Scale Invasion  
For complex features:
```bash
/create-prd ‚Üí /process-prd-feedback ‚Üí /tasks-from-plan ‚Üí /implement-issue (multiple)
```

### The Audit Operation - Inspection Ready
For code quality:
```bash
/security-review ‚Üí /perf-review ‚Üí /quality-review
```

### The Learning Mission - Intelligence Gathering
For understanding:
```bash
/codebase-overview ‚Üí /explain ‚Üí /learn
```

## üí° Pro Tips from the Veterans

1. **Use the mentor for onboarding** - `/learn this codebase` creates personalized boot camp training

2. **Deploy the junior developer for fresh perspectives** - `/beginners-mind` or @agent-junior-developer questions assumptions and uncovers hidden complexity

3. **Chain reviews for comprehensive analysis** - Security ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Quality (The holy trinity of code warfare)

4. **Let specialists own their domain** - @agent-database-designer for schemas, @agent-api-designer for endpoints. Trust your officers!

5. **Track complex work with todos** - Your mission control dashboard. Never lose sight of objectives!

6. **Review PRs before merging** - `/arch-review "PR #123"` - Final inspection before deployment to production theater

7. **Document as you go** - @agent-code-documentor should follow feature implementation. Leave no soldier's story untold!

8. **Modernize incrementally** - Use `/modernization-review` to identify upgrade opportunities. Rome wasn't rebuilt in a day!

## üöÅ Emergency Protocols - When Things Go FUBAR

**When stuck (Code KIA - Knowledge In Absence):**
```bash
/explain [confusing-code]
/mentor  # Get personalized help
```

**When slow (Performance MIA - Missing In Action):**
```bash
/perf-review
/database-review
/concurrency-review
```

**When buggy (Hostile Bugs Detected):**
```bash
@agent-debugger  # Call in the bug hunter
/test-review  # Fortify your defenses
```

**When messy (Code Discipline Breakdown):**
```bash
/refactor-review
/arch-review
```
