## üéñÔ∏è Command Structure - The Workflows

### 1. The PRD ‚Üí Production Pipeline

The most powerful workflow - from idea to deployed feature:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements] -->|/create-prd| B[PRD Document]
    B -->|/tasks-from-plan| C[GitHub Issues]
    C -->|/implement-issue| D[Implemented Code]
    D -->|Review & Test| E[Production]
```

**Example Campaign:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create a PRD from your requirements
/create-prd requirements/new-feature.md

# Step 2: Review the generated PRD
# Step 3: Process feedback if needed
/process-prd-feedback "Add mobile support"

# Step 4: Create GitHub issues from the PRD
/tasks-from-plan /plans/prd-*.md

# Step 5: Implement each issue
/implement-issue 101
/implement-issue 102
```

### 2. The Review & Improve Protocol

Systematic code improvement across all dimensions:

```bash
# Security audit
/security-review "current changes"

# Performance analysis  
/perf-review src/slow-module

# Architecture review
/arch-review "PR #45"

# Full quality assessment
/quality-review

# Database optimization
/database-review
```

Each review generates a comprehensive report in `/plans/` with:
- Current state analysis
- Prioritized issues (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Detailed improvement plan
- Effort estimates
- Success metrics

### 3. The Learning & Mastery Path

For understanding and knowledge transfer:

```bash
# Understand the codebase
/codebase-overview

# Get personalized explanations
/explain src/complex-algorithm.ts

# Create a learning path
/learn React hooks in this project

# Deep dive into architecture
/arch-review
```

## üéÆ Advanced Tactics

### Scope Modifiers for Reviews

All review commands support intelligent scoping:

- **No argument** - Review entire project
- **Path** - Review specific file/directory
- **"current changes"** - Review uncommitted changes
- **"recent changes"** - Review recent commits  
- **"PR #123"** - Review a pull request

### Coordinated Attacks

Deploy multiple agents for complex operations:

```bash
# Modernize and optimize simultaneously
/modernization-review src/legacy
/perf-review src/legacy
/tasks-from-plan /plans/modernization-review-*.md
```

### Specialized Formations

For specific scenarios:

**The Security Hardening**
```bash
/security-review
/test-review  # Ensure security tests
/deployment-review  # Secure deployment
```

**The Performance Blitz**
```bash
/perf-review
/database-review
/concurrency-review
```

**The Quality Offensive**
```bash
/quality-review
/test-review
/doc-review
```

## üìä Best Practices from the Field

### 1. Start with Reconnaissance
Always begin with `/codebase-overview` or `/explain` to understand the terrain.

### 2. Plan Before Attacking
Use `/create-prd` or `/decompose-issue` for complex tasks. Let the development-manager break down the work.

### 3. Deploy Specialists
Don't use generic agents when specialists exist. Use @api-designer for APIs, not @architect.

### 4. Review After Action
After implementation, run relevant review commands to ensure quality.

### 5. Document Victories
The @code-documentor should follow major implementations to maintain clarity.

### 6. Coordinate Forces
Multiple agents can work in parallel - use the todo system to track progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Your Workflow

### With GitHub Issues
```bash
# Decompose large issues
/decompose-issue 42

# Implement with the right specialist
/implement-issue 43

# Create PRs with context
/create-pr "recent changes"
```

### With Existing Code
```bash
# Understand before modifying
/explain src/module.ts

# Review before refactoring
/refactor-review src/module.ts

# Modernize systematically
/modernization-review src/legacy
```

### For New Features
```bash
# Start with requirements
/create-prd feature-spec.md

# Or decompose an issue
/decompose-issue 100

# Then implement systematically
/implement-issue 101
```

## üéØ Mission Types

### The Quick Strike
For small, focused tasks:
```bash
/implement-issue 42
```

### The Planned Campaign  
For complex features:
```bash
/create-prd ‚Üí /process-prd-feedback ‚Üí /tasks-from-plan ‚Üí /implement-issue (multiple)
```

### The Audit Operation
For code quality:
```bash
/security-review ‚Üí /perf-review ‚Üí /quality-review
```

### The Learning Mission
For understanding:
```bash
/codebase-overview ‚Üí /explain ‚Üí /learn
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use the mentor for onboarding** - `/learn this codebase` creates personalized learning paths

2. **Chain reviews for comprehensive analysis** - Security ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Quality

3. **Let specialists own their domain** - @database-designer for schemas, @api-designer for endpoints

4. **Track complex work with todos** - The system automatically manages task lists

5. **Review PRs before merging** - `/arch-review "PR #123"` ensures consistency

6. **Document as you go** - @code-documentor should follow feature implementation

7. **Modernize incrementally** - Use `/modernization-review` to identify upgrade opportunities

## üöÅ Emergency Protocols

**When stuck:**
```bash
/explain [confusing-code]
/mentor  # Get personalized help
```

**When slow:**
```bash
/perf-review
/database-review
/concurrency-review
```

**When buggy:**
```bash
@debugger  # Direct agent invocation
/test-review  # Improve test coverage
```

**When messy:**
```bash
/refactor-review
/arch-review
```
