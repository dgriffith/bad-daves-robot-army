# PRD: Implementation Plan from PRD Slash Command

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** August 9, 2025  
**Author:** Product Manager Agent  
**Status:** Draft  

## Executive Summary

The "implementation-plan-from-prd" slash command will transform Product Requirements Documents into comprehensive technical implementation plans. This tool addresses the critical gap between product vision and development execution by generating detailed, actionable implementation roadmaps that development managers and technical leads can immediately use to guide their teams.

**Key Value Proposition:** Automatically convert high-level product requirements into structured technical implementation plans with architecture breakdowns, resource estimates, risk assessments, and clear development phases.

## Product Vision

### Problem Statement
Development managers and technical leads frequently receive PRDs that clearly articulate product vision and user requirements but lack the technical depth needed for effective implementation planning. This creates a bottleneck where technical leaders must manually translate business requirements into:
- Technical architecture decisions
- Development phases and milestones
- Resource allocation estimates
- Risk identification and mitigation strategies
- Dependency mapping
- Testing strategies

This manual translation process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to overlooking critical technical considerations.

### Solution Vision
Create an intelligent slash command that automatically analyzes PRD content and generates comprehensive implementation plans tailored to the specific technical requirements and constraints of each project. The tool will serve as a bridge between product strategy and technical execution.
