# Bad Dave's Robot Army

Your elite development force - a comprehensive suite of specialized AI agents and slash commands for Claude Code that supercharge your development workflow.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

**New to the Robot Army?** Read the [Robot Army Guide](docs/ROBOT_ARMY_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive documentation, workflows, and battle-tested tactics.

**Ready to deploy?** Install the agents and commands:

```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Install globally to ~/.claude/
make install

# Install to a specific project
make install PROJECT=/path/to/project
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Inside

This repository includes **34+ slash commands** and specialized subagents organized into:

- **Review & Analysis Commands** - Security, performance, architecture, testing, quality audits
- **Code Intelligence Commands** - History analysis, evolution tracking, codebase understanding
- **Development Workflow Commands** - PRD creation, implementation planning, issue decomposition
- **Learning & Documentation Commands** - Explanations, mentoring, fresh perspectives
- **Specialized Agents** - API design, database optimization, cloud architecture, and more

See the [Robot Army Guide](docs/ROBOT_ARMY_GUIDE.md) for the complete arsenal and usage examples.

## Agent Installation Tooling

This repository includes tooling for installing Claude agents and commands from the repository to your local `~/.claude/` directory or to a specific project's `.claude/` directory.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Install agents and commands globally to ~/.claude/
make install

# Install to a specific project directory
make install PROJECT=/path/to/project

# Install with options
make install ARGS='--dry-run --verbose'

# Install to current project directory
./scripts/install-agents.sh .
```

### Features

- **Global or project-specific installation** - Install to ~/.claude/ or to a specific project's .claude/
- **Selective overwriting** with confirmation prompts
- **Dry-run mode** for safe testing
- **Verbose output** for detailed operation logs
- **Force mode** to overwrite without prompting
- **Automatic directory creation**

### Install Script Usage

The main install script is located at `scripts/install-agents.sh`:

```bash
# Show help
./scripts/install-agents.sh --help

# Install globally to ~/.claude/
./scripts/install-agents.sh

# Install to a specific project directory
./scripts/install-agents.sh /path/to/project

# Install to current directory's project
./scripts/install-agents.sh .

# Options
--dry-run    # Show what would be done without making changes
--verbose    # Show detailed output
--force      # Overwrite without prompting
```

### Project-Specific Installation

You can install the agents and commands to a specific project's `.claude/` directory instead of the global `~/.claude/` directory:

```bash
# Install to a specific project
./scripts/install-agents.sh /path/to/my-project

# This will create:
# /path/to/my-project/.claude/agents/
# /path/to/my-project/.claude/commands/
```

This is useful when you want project-specific agents and commands that don't affect your global Claude configuration.

### Installation Directories

The install script creates and manages these directories:

- **Global installation**: `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/commands/`
- **Project installation**: `<project>/.claude/agents/` and `<project>/.claude/commands/`

### Safety Features

The install script includes several safety features:

- **Confirmation prompts** when overwriting existing files
- **File comparison** to skip identical files
- **Dry-run mode** to preview changes without making them
- **Force mode** for automated installations

### Best Practices

1. **Global installation**: Use `make install` for your personal development environment
2. **Project-specific**: Use `./scripts/install-agents.sh .` when working on a specific project
3. **Test first**: Use `--dry-run` to preview what will be installed
4. **CI/CD**: Use `--force` for automated deployments

### Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors**: Ensure scripts are executable with `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- **Directory not found**: The script automatically creates necessary directories
- **Overwrite prompts**: Use `--force` to skip confirmation prompts
- **Project directory**: Ensure the project directory exists before installing
